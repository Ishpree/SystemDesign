->Pizza rate calculation based on toppings
->Coffee machine design

Decorator pattern is used to avoid class explosion 
which means lets say there is a base pizza then there is a topping of cheese , 
topping of jalapeno, topping of tomato

we will have to create mutliple classes like base pizza, base+cheese, base+cheese+tomato
which is not very feasible when there are many combinations

Decorator function helps with that.
