SpringBoot Theory
   
**What is a Bean?**
->Java Object. When the java object is managed by the spring application, it is referred to as Bean.

**What is Spring IOC container?**
->Manages all the beans inside the springboot application along with the dependecies of those beans.
->Bean deletion, bean injection everything will be managed by the IOC container

**What is application context?**
->It is the implementation of the spring IOC container. the terms spring ioc container and application context
may be used interchangibly.
->Business object and Configuration Metadata(Annotations)
->Say there is a java object, that java object will be converted to a bean 
using the configurations and then will be stored inside the application context


**2 ways to create a Bean**
->@Component: For example if we are using @service annotation, if we go inside it, there will be a 
component annotation, so whatever annotation we used it will have the component annotation as a part of it.
->@Configuration and @Bean: 

****How to check if the beans are present in application****
->Using actuators:
->using object of application context 

**What is REST(Representational State Transfer) API**
-An architectural style for desgining networked applications. It leverages HTTP methods, GET, POST, PUT, 
DELETE to perform CRUD operations on resources identified by URLs
Its simple, scalable , decouples the client and the server 

**Loose coupling**: When components are independent and have minimal depencies . In microservercies architecture
**Tight coupling**: In monolithic architectures
Mostly loose coupling is only preferred but tight coupling can be benefinical when performance optimization is needed.
